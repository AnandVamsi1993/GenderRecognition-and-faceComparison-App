# GenderRecognition-and-faceComparison-App
This is one of Anand's projects on gender classification through facerecognition. By using SVM, the model was trained with 7000 male and female images. This model has an overall accuracy of 80%. The second half of this project supports a facecomparison app developed directly from the python's face_recognition module.
